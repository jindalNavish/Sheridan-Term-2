<span>Firstly</span>,<section> I want to talk <h1>about Nervous system it is divided into</h1> two sub-categories Central nervous system and Peripheral <h2>nervous system. The <b>central</b> nervous system consists of mainly brain and spinal </h2>cord whereas Peripheral <strong>nervous system consists of all the nerves outside</strong> the brain and spinal cord mainly responsible for exchanging information from central nervous system</section>. This is where Neuron acts its main responsibility which is receiving and sending signals throughout  the human body, Dendrites which is subpart of Neuron helps to receives the information from other Neurons  whereas Axonâ€™s main responsibility is to send information to the other Neurons ,<div> The Axon gets help from Myelin  which is a fatty substance coating the Axon helping to speed up the neural impulse by telling the neuron to start or stop producing chemical as per the requirement of the system. Myelin is produced by the Glial Cells which also aids to uphold the structure of Neurons. An interesting fact is that two neurons never actually touch other due to the Synapse which is the space between Axon and Dendrite</div>. Another interesting fact that piqued my interest was the fact that neuron fires neurotransmitters completely or not at all depending on if the threshold is reached or not. Now, I will talk about Neurotransmitters which are the chemicals stored in the Synapse when released it causes an electrical and chemical reaction between the Neurons an example of these chemical reactions is: - Excessive dopamine being released causing adrenaline rush, When Neurotransmitters are released, it can cause either excitatory or an inhibitory reaction.
<article class="jod">, I will<mark> talk about Cortex which is a <span>hmmmmmm</span> in brain</mark> which <em>may consist of up to 30000 neurons, Cortex</em> helps us to see the reality<i> by filtering the information </i>we see around us it <h6>is also responsible for every</h6> sensation we feel such as touch, smell etc.</article>    Cortex is often referred to as the thinking part of the brain as it helps us to think new ideas, learn, create fresh memories etc. Modern medicine is also created by keeping the neurons in regard as they are created in two fashions agonist or antagonist the former used to mimic the natural chemicals of the Neuron such as dopamine which enables to cure the deficiency of dopamine for example. Whereas antagonist is made up to block the receptor site so the excessive chemicals are reduced significantly.

<p id="Last"> Learning is a process of change in behaviour that might happen due to experience or practice. Classical conditioning is to make a natural innate response to a stimulus other than the prior stimulus that would have produced the reflex, there are two types of responses Unconditioned response and Conditioned response brought on by Unconditioned stimulus and Conditioned response respectively. It can be further explained by the experiment conducted by Pavlov in which he ringed a bell (Neutral Stimulus) just before presenting the food (Unconditioned stimulus) to his dog  over time by ringing the bell continuously before presenting the food to his dog for a prolonged time the  dog eventually started to Salivate just on the sound of a bell producing a conditioned response but there are few requirements for Classical Conditioning that being, Conditioned Stimulus should came before Unconditioned Stimulus and should be just a few seconds apart while Conditioned Stimulus should also be distinguished from other competing stimuli. There are some constraints to Classical Conditioning as well that being   1) Stimulus Generalization in which the subject responds to a stimulus that mimics the original Conditioned Stimulus. 2)Stimulus Extinction in which the Conditioned Response starts to fade away over time when the Conditioned Stimulus is not presented to the subject overtime.   </p>
