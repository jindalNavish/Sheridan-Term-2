    Learning is a process of change in behaviour that might happen due to experience or practice. Classical conditioning is to make a natural innate response to a stimulus other than the prior stimulus that would have produced the reflex, there are two types of responses Unconditioned response and Conditioned response brought on by Unconditioned stimulus and Conditioned response respectively. It can be further explained by the experiment conducted by Pavlov in which he ringed a bell (Neutral Stimulus) just before presenting the food (Unconditioned stimulus) to his dog  over time by ringing the bell continuously before presenting the food to his dog for a prolonged time the  dog eventually started to Salivate just on the sound of a bell producing a conditioned response but there are few requirements for Classical Conditioning that being, Conditioned Stimulus should came before Unconditioned Stimulus and should be just a few seconds apart while Conditioned Stimulus should also be distinguished from other competing stimuli. There are some constraints to Classical Conditioning as well that being   1) Stimulus Generalization in which the subject responds to a stimulus that mimics the original Conditioned Stimulus. 2)Stimulus Extinction in which the Conditioned Response starts to fade away over time when the Conditioned Stimulus is not presented to the subject overtime.

Another interesting example of Classical Conditioning is the experiment conducted by John Watson called ‘Little Albert’ by today’s standard it would have been regarded as immoral and wouldn't have seen the day of light as it featured a little infant called Albert and was subjected to loud screams (Unconditioned Stimuli) with association of a white rat (Neutral Stimuli) shown before the loud noise. Overtime, Albert started to fear white rats and white animals in general as Little Albert started to associate white animals with fear and thus creating a case of Classical Conditioning. The whole point of the experiment for John Watson was to prove that the upbringing of a child is more dependent on the child’s environment rather than the genes of the parents.
